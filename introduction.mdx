## Configure Jira Integration

### 2-Way Sync

2-Way Sync provides automatically syncing data between Roadmape and Jira when thereâ€™s a change on either platform.

<Note> Roadmape items will need to be manually pushed if you do not enable 2-Way Sync. </Note>

Check the checkbox if you want to enable 2-Way Sync.

### Enable / Disable

The Jira Integration can be disabled at any time by using the toggle. 
After enabling it again, Jira Integration will work properly.

### Item Type Mapping

Through item type mapping, you can connect your Jira issue types to Roadmape item types.

If there is no item type you want to map in Roadmape, you can create a new item type in Items Page.

Click the ***+Add New*** button for mapping item types that have not yet been mapped to Roadmape.

### Status & Field Mapping

Field mapping allows you to match Jira fields to Roadmape fields. After mapping the fields, you also need to map the options of some fields.

If you don't want to sync certain fields with Jira, you can remove them.

In order to use Jira Integration properly, fields & status must be correctly mapped. Also you can change the mapping after the installation, too.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up a reliable and efficient two-way integration between Roadmape and Jira that will save you time and improve the productivity of your team.
